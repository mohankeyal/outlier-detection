Python project on outlier detection using python. Data from a CSV file is imported and analysed to distinguish outliers mong the normal data.
Run the Main.ipynb file
The main file imports data from the wifi_localization.txt file
This project is intended to read the data from the text file, analyse it and point out outliers in this data. All the sets of data which lie outside the "usual" or "normal" territory are marked as outliers and subsequently plotted into graphs.
